### This is supposed to be an example repo of how i use fabric in nixos ^^

---

Configuration.nix and home.nix are in [hosts/nixos](https://github.com/HeyImKyu/fabric-flakes-example/tree/main/hosts/nixos)

The fabric configuration is imported in home.nix and is located in [modules/homemanager/fabric/default.nix](https://github.com/HeyImKyu/fabric-flakes-example/blob/main/modules/home-manager/fabric/default.nix)
